x = 10
x = x + 5

'''
More appropriate ways to get 
the same result as x = x + 5 
and make my code smaller 

'''
#x += 5
#x -= 5
#x *= 5
#x /= 5 

#x %= 5 Fits twice within 10 | no remainder
#x %= 4 Fits twice within 10 | remainder 2
#x %= 6 Fits once in 10      | remainder 4

'''
If we use %= basically python will 
tell us that 3 fits 3 times inside 
10 and 1 is the remainder/surplus

'''
#x %= 3


print(x)
